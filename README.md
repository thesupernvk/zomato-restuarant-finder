## What is this about?

Zomato is an Indian restaurant search and discovery service founded in 2008. It currently operates in 24 countries. It provides information and reviews on restaurants, including images of menus where the restaurant does not have its own website.

My web-app is based on the free to use API exposed by Zomato (https://developers.zomato.com/documentation)

# What this web-app does?

It takes a city name/area name and calls the API to get the top-3 restaurants in the searched area.
It also shows picture uploaded by the restaurant and the average cost of food for 2.
