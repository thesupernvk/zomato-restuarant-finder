## What is this APP about?

Zomato is a popular restuarnt aggregator service based in India. User can search for popular restuarants, make reservations and check prices on this app/site.

For my demonstration, I have limited the scope to only searching for a city and displaying the top 3 restuarants in that city/area.

My app also displays the top cuisine among foodies in that particular area.
